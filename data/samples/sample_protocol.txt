STUDY PROTOCOL

Title: Effectiveness of Community Health Worker Interventions on Child Mortality in Rural Tanzania

Primary Objective:
This study aims to evaluate whether community health worker (CHW) interventions reduce under-five child mortality in rural Tanzania compared to standard care.

Secondary Objectives:
1. To assess the effect of CHW visits on treatment adherence
2. To determine the association between socioeconomic status and health outcomes

Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that children in households receiving CHW visits will have significantly lower mortality rates compared to controls.

Study Design:
This is a retrospective cohort study using routine health records from 2018-2023.

Sample Size:
A sample size of 450 participants was calculated based on 80% power and alpha 0.05.

Primary Outcome:
The primary outcome is child mortality (death within 5 years of age).

Variables Collected:
Age, sex, treatment assignment, district, education level of mother, income, baseline weight, follow-up duration, CHW visit frequency.

Statistical Analysis:
Logistic regression will be used to assess the association between CHW intervention and mortality, adjusting for age, sex, and socioeconomic variables.
